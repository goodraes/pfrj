　　时光如白驹过隙，父亲已不再年轻，疾病也悄然降临。父亲的一只手已无法再拉动那心爱的琴弦，可他每天都要用那活动不便的手摸　一摸二胡，并拂去上面的落尘。疾病缠身的父亲并没有失去对音乐的兴趣，每周五他都会准时地守候在电视机前收看《同一首歌》，我和姐姐玩笑地称他为“老追星族”。父亲说：“我追的不是歌星而是音乐，一支优美的旋律代表着一段难忘的岁月，你看台下的观众在那儿如醉如痴地舞动着荧光棒，他们不一定是为了应和台上的演员，更多的是在追忆他们和那支乐曲同在的岁月”听完父亲的“高见”，我一时不无言，难道不是吗？多少难忘的旋律让人怀念的是过去的时光。
春草破茧的蝴蝶，夏荷盛开的星野，秋叶处置的海浪，冬檐培养的潮江，无非是情思两眼兴盛的多墨，无非是情心遨游云霄的金子，无非是情境牵手了鹞子有山河，无非是不期而遇了诗书天然的考察。

His father's hand has been unable to pull the strings of the beloved, but he every day with the mobility of a hand touching the erhu, and brushed the dust fall.
Ailing father did not lose interest in music, every Friday he will be on time waiting for you in front of the television to watch "the same song", my sister and I called him "old fans joke.
Father said: "I am not a singer, but music, a beautiful melody represents a period of unforgettable years, you stand under the audience dancing glo-sticks there was bewitched, they don't have to be to should be the stage actors, music, and that's more of a recall them in the years of" after hearing his father's "vision", do not silence me for the moment, isn't it?
How many memorable melodies make people miss is the past.
Spring grass broken cocoon of a butterfly, summer lotus blooming star field, disposal of the waves the autumn leaves, winter eaves of tidal river, is nothing but the emotion more than two eyes thriving ink, is nothing but gold heart into the sky, there is nothing but the situation in hand kite was, now is nothing but ran into the natural.
